## 📖 Interactive Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:

- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc

You can test all endpoints directly from the browser!

## 🧪 Testing

### Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, how are you?"}'
```

### Using Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat",
    json={"message": "Explain FastAPI"}
)
print(response.json())
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to Git
- API keys are loaded from environment variables
- Rate limiting recommended for production
- Input validation handled by Pydantic models

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add authentication (API keys)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add response caching
- [ ] Support for streaming responses
- [ ] Database integration for conversation history
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Unit tests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Invalid API key" error
- Check your `.env` file has the correct OpenAI API key
- Ensure `.env` is in the same directory as `main.py`

### Port already in use
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```
